In 37% of Americans, the thirst mechanism is so weak that it is often mistaken for hunger. \r\n\r\n3. Even MILD dehydration will slow down one's metabolism as much as 3%. \r\n\r\n4. One glass of water will shut down midnight hunger pangs for almost 100% of the dieters studied in a U-Washington study. \r\n\r\n5. Lack of water, the #1 trigger of daytime fatigue. \r\n\r\n6. Preliminary research indicates that 8-10 glasses of water a day could significantly ease back and joint pain for up to 80% of sufferers. \r\n\r\n7. A mere 2% drop in body water can trigger fuzzy short-term memory, trouble with basic math, and difficulty focusing on the computer screen or on a printed page. \r\n\r\n8. Drinking 5 glasses of water daily decreases the risk of colon cancer by 45%, plus it can slash the risk of breast cancer by 79%, and one is 50% less likely to develop bladder cancer. \r\n\r\nAre you drinking the amount of water you should every day? \r\n\r\nC o k e\r\n1. In many states (in the USA) the highway patrol carries two gallons of Coke in the truck to remove blood from the highway after a car accident. \r\n\r\n2. You can put a T-bone steak in a bowl of coke and it will be gone in two days. \r\n\r\n3. To clean a toilet: Pour a can of Coca-Cola into the toilet bowl and let the \"real thing\" sit for one hour, then flush clean. The citric acid in Coke removes stains from vitreous China. \r\n\r\n4.

To remove grease from clothes: Empty a can of coke into a load of greasy clothes, add detergent, and run through a regular cycle. The Coca-Cola will help loosen grease stains. It will also clean road haze from your windshield. Check it out. \r\n\r\nFor Your Info :\r\n1. The active ingredient in Coke is phosphoric acid. Its pH is 2.8. It will dissolve a nail in about 4 days. Phosphoric acid also leaches calcium from bones and is a major contributor to the rising increase in osteoporosis. \r\n\r\n2. To carry Coca-Cola syrup (the concentrate) the commercial truck must use the Hazardous material place cards reserved for highly corrosive materials. \r\n\r\n3. The distributors of coke have been using it to clean the engines of their trucks for about 20 years! \r\n\r\nNow the question is, would you like a glass of water or coke?",

        "body": "I think Santa Claus is a woman... I hate to be the one to defy sacred myth, but I believe he's a she. Think about it. Christmas is a big, organized, warm, fuzzy, nurturing social deal, and I have a tough time believing a guy could possibly pull it all off! \r\nFor starters, the vast majority of men don't even think about selecting gifts until Christmas Eve. It's as if they are all frozen in some kind of ebenezerian Time Warp until 3 p.m. on Dec. 24th, when they - with amazing calm - call other errant men and plan for a last-minute shopping spree. Once at the mall, they always seem surprised to find only Ronco products, socket wrench sets, and mood rings left on the shelves. You might think this would send them into a fit of panic and guilt, but my husband tells me it's an enormous relief because it lessens the 11th hour decision-making burden. On this count alone, I'm convinced Santa is a woman. Surely, if he were a man, everyone in the universe would wake up Christmas morning to find a rotating, musical Chia Pet under the tree, still in the bag. \r\n\r\nAnother problem for a he-Santa would be getting there. First of all, there would be no reindeer because they would all be dead, gutted, and strapped onto the rear bumper of the sleigh amid wide-eyed, desperate claims that buck season had been extended. Blitzen's rack would already be on the way to the taxidermist. \r\n\r\nEven if the male Santa DID have reindeer, he'd still have transportation problems because he would inevitably get lost up there in the snow and clouds and then refuse to stop and ask for directions. Add to this the fact that there would be unavoidable delays in the chimney, where the Bob Vila-like Santa would stop to inspect and repoint bricks in the flue. He would also need to check for carbon monoxide fumes in every gas fireplace, and get under every Christmas tree that is crooked to straighten it to a perfectly upright 90-degree angle. \r\n\r\nOther reasons why Santa can't possibly be a man: \r\n\r\n* Men can't pack a bag.\r\n* Men would rather be dead than caught wearing red velvet.\r\n* Men would feel their masculinity is threatened... having to be seen with all those elves.\r\n* Men don't answer their mail.\r\n* Men would refuse to allow their physique to be described even in jest as anything remotely resembling a \"bowlful of jelly.\"\r\n* Men aren't interested in stockings unless somebody's wearing them.\r\n* Having to do the Ho Ho Ho thing would seriously inhibit their ability to pick up women.\r\n* Finally, being responsible for Christmas would require a commitment. \r\n\r\nI can buy the fact that other mythical characters are men... Father Time shows up once a year unshaven and looking ominous. Definite guy. Cupid flies around carrying weapons. Uncle Sam is a politician who likes to point fingers. Any one of these individuals could pass the testosterone-screening test. But not St. Nick. Not a chance. However, as long as we have each other, good will, peace on earth, faith and Nat King Cole's version of \"The Christmas Song,\" it probably makes little difference what gender Santa is. I just wish she'd quit dressing like a guy.",

        "body": "Tech Support  \r\n\r\nJust in case you think you are TC (technologically challenged). The following is an excerpt taken from a Wall Street Journal article:\r\n\r\n    1. Compaq is considering changing the command \"Press Any Key\" to \"Press Return Key\" because of the flood of calls asking where the \"Any\" key is.\r\n\r\n    2. AST technical support had a caller complaining that her mouse was hard to control with the dust cover on. The cover turned out to be the plastic bag the mouse was packaged in.\r\n\r\n    3. Another Compaq technician received a call from a man complaining that the system wouldn't read word processing files from his old diskettes. After trouble-shooting for magnets and heat failed to diagnose the problem, it was found that the customer had labeled the diskettes, then rolled them into the typewriter to type the labels.\r\n\r\n    4. Another AST customer was asked to send a copy of her defective diskettes. A few days later a letter arrived from the customer along with photocopies of the floppies.\r\n\r\n    5. A Dell technician advised his customer to put his troubled floppy back in the drive and close the door. The customer asked the tech to hold on, and was heard putting the phone down, getting up and crossing the room to close the door to his room.\r\n\r\n    6. Another Dell customer called to say he couldn't get his computer to fax anything. After 40 minutes of trouble-shooting, the technician discovered the man was trying to fax a piece of paper by holding it in front of the monitor screen and hitting the \"send\" key.\r\n\r\n    7. Yet another Dell customer called to complain that his keyboard no longer worked. He had cleaned it by filling up his tub with soap and water and soaking the keyboard for a day, then removing all the keys and washing them individually.\r\n\r\n    8. A Dell technician received a call from a customer who was enraged because his computer had told him he was \"bad and an invalid\". The tech explained that the computer's \"bad command\" and \"invalid\" responses shouldn't be taken personally.\r\n\r\n    9. A confused caller to IBM was having troubles printing documents. He told the technician that the computer had said it \"couldn't find printer\". The user had also tried turning the computer screen to face the printer - but that his computer still couldn't \"see\" the printer.\r\n\r\n    10. An exasperated caller to Dell Computer Tech Support couldn't get her new Dell Computer to turn on. After ensuring the computer was plugged in, the technician asked her what happened when she pushed the power button. Her response, \"I pushed and pushed on this foot pedal and nothing happens.\" The \"foot pedal\" turned out to be the computer's mouse.\r\n\r\n    11. Another customer called Compaq tech support to say her brand-new computer wouldn't  work. She said she unpacked the unit, plugged it in and sat there for 20 minutes waiting for something to happen. When asked what happened when she pressed the power switch, she asked \"What power switch?\"\r\n\r\n    12. True story from a Novell NetWire SysOp:\r\n\r\nCaller: \"Hello, is this Tech Support?\"\r\nTech: \"Yes, it is. How may I help you?\"\r\nCaller: \"The cup holder on my PC is broken and I am within my warranty period. How do I go about getting that fixed?\"\r\nTech: \"I'm sorry, but did you say a cup holder?\"\r\nCaller: \"Yes, it's attached to the front of my computer.\"\r\nTech: \"Please excuse me if I seem a bit stumped, It's because I am. Did you receive this as part of a promotional, at a trade show? How did you get this cup holder? Does it   have any trademark on it?\"\r\nCaller: \"It came with my computer, I don't know anything about a promotional. It just has '4X' on it.\" At this point the Tech Rep had to mute the caller, because he couldn't stand it. He was laughing too hard. The caller had been using the load drawer of the CD-ROM drive as a cup holder, and snapped it off the drive!\r\n\r\n    13. Another IBM customer had troubles installing software and rang for support. \"I put in the first disk, and that was OK. It said to put in the second disk, and had some problems with the disk. When it said to put in the third disk - I couldn't even fit it in...\" The user hadn't realized that \"Insert Disk 2\" meant to remove Disk 1 first.\r\n\r\n    14. In a similar incident, a customer had followed the instructions for installing software. The instructions said to remove the disk from it's cover and insert into the drive. The user had physically removed the casing of the disk and wondered why there were problems.\r\n\r\n    As Ripley would say, believe it or not!",

The woman who took the call asked where Vermont was.

One day, he was typing and turned to a secretary and said, \"I'm almost out of typing paper. What do I do?\" \r\n\"Just use copier machine paper,\" she told him. \r\nWith that, the intern took his last remaining blank piece of paper, put it on the photocopier and proceeded to make five blank copies. \r\n\r\nOne of our servers crashed. I was watching our new system administrator trying to restore it. He inserted a CD and needed to type a path name to a directory named \"i386.\" \r\nHe started to type it and paused, asking me, \"Where's the key for that line thing?\" \r\nI asked what he was talking about, and he said, \"You know, that one that looks like an upside-down exclamation mark.\" \r\nI replied, \"You mean the letter 'i'?\" \r\nAnd he said, \"Yeah, that's it!\" \r\n\r\nI was in a car dealership a while ago when a large motor home was towed into the garage. The front of the vehicle was in dire need of repair and the whole thing generally looked like it had been an extra in \"Twister.\" I asked the manager what had happened. He told me that the driver had set the cruise control, and then went in back to make a sandwich.",

The truck got stuck and I couldn't get it out no matter how I tried. I radioed in for help and eventually a local cop shows up to take the report. He went through his basic questioning ok, no problem. I thought sure he was clear of needing a sign until he asked \"So..is your truck stuck?\" I couldn't help myself!

The doctor told him that he has a rare disease that will require him to take this medication for several months to clear up the disease; however the medication will make his hair fall out permanently. \r\nSeveral months later the guy's eyes are still bulging and his ears are still protruding - more so now that his hair is gone, so this time he goes to a different doctor who informs him that he has a prostate problem and that they will have to remove his testicles. The guy has the surgery only to find his eyes are still bulging and his ears are still protruding. \r\n\r\nDetermined to find out what is wrong with him, he goes to another doctor who tells him that the nerves in his hands are pinching the nerve endings in his ears and his eyes and the only way to resolve the problem is to have his hands amputated. Sadly, the guy lets his hands be amputated. \r\n\r\nOn a follow-up visit to this doctor the doctor informs him that while they were doing the surgery on his hands, they made a deadly mistake and that he only has months to live. The guy is hysterical at this point and resolves that if he only has months to live he is going to live it up, so he goes out to buy a brand new sports car, new furniture, and a new wardrobe.

He has been around forever, so I wouldn't put it past him to come up with something like this. \r\nAnyway, one year there were these two guys who were taking Chemistry and who did pretty well on all of the quizzes and the mid-terms and labs, etc., such that going into the final they had a solid A. These friends were so confident going into the final that the weekend before finals week (even though the Chem final was on Monday), they decided to go up to U Virginia and party with some friends up there. \r\n\r\nThey did this and had a great time. However, with their hangovers and everything, they overslept all day Sunday and didn't make it back to Duke until early Monday morning. Rather than taking the final then, they found Professor Bonk after the final and explained to him why they missed the final. They told him that they went up to UVA for the weekend, and had planned to come back in time to study, but that they had a flat tire on the way back and didn't have a spare and couldn't get help for a long time and so were late getting back to campus. \r\n\r\nBonk thought this over and then agreed that they could make up the final on the following day. The two guys were elated, relieved and very proud of their story. So, they studied that night and went in the next day at the time Bonk had told them. He placed them in separate rooms and handed each of them a test booklet and told them to begin. \r\n\r\nThey looked at the first problem, which was something simple about molarity and solutions and was worth 5 points. \"Cool,\" they thought, \"this is going to be easy.\" They did that problem and turned the page.

She loved them, but unfortunately they always gave her a very embarrassing, and somewhat lively reaction. When it became apparent that she and her boyfriend would marry she thought to herself, \"He is such a sweet and gentle man but I don't think he can live with my problems.\" So she decided to make the supreme sacrifice and give up beans. \r\nA year later her car broke down on the way home from work. Since she lived in the country, she called her husband and told him she would be late because she had to walk home. On her way, she passed a small diner and the odor of the baked beans was more than she could stand. Since she still had miles to walk, she figured that she could walk off any ill effect by the time she reached home. So she stopped at the diner, and before she knew it she had consumed three large orders of baked beans. All the way home she putt-putted. \r\n\r\nUpon arriving home she felt reasonably sure she could control it. Her husband seemed excited to see her, exclaming delightedly, \"Darling, I have a surprise for dinner tonight.\" He then blindfolded her then led her to a chair at the table. Just as he was about to remove the blindfold the phone rang. He made her promise not to touch the blindfold till he came back, then he went to answer the phone. \r\n\r\nThe baked beans she had consumed were still affecting her and the pressure was becoming almost unbearable, so while her husband was out of the room she seized the opportunity, shifted the weight to one leg, and let it go. It was not only loud, but it smelt like a fertilizer truck running over a skunk coming from a pulp mill. She took a napkin and fanned the air around her vigorously. Then she shifted to the other cheek and ripped three more, which reminded her of cabbage cooking. Keeping her ears turned to the conversation in the other room, she went on like this for another ten minutes. When the phone farewells signed the end of her freedom, she fanned the air a few more times with the napkin, placed it on her lap and folded her hands upon it, smiling contentedly to herself, she was the picture of innocence when her husband returned. Apologizing for taking so long, he asked her if she peeked and she assured him that she had not. At this point, he removes the blindfold to reveal twelve dinner guests seated around the table to wish her a first Happy Anniversary!",
